## Hello There!

I am currently a student and project manager at [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/). There is rightfully an immense emphasis on application (the hows and whys) rather than memorization (the whats). We have access to vast, in-depth pools of information, but I personally wanted a concise, centralized store of definitions and brief explanations. To this end, I've created this glossary for myself and my peers to fork, clone, and make their own. I will continue to update this glossary as I progress through the Lambda School curriculum. Please notify me of any errors or inaccuracies and I will be sure to correct them in the master branch.

Thanks for stopping by!
